# UnityTerrainEditorV3
Tile Based Unity Terrain Editor Third Version (Current)

Base code for Unity based game idea's initial feature development of modular tile terrain system. Running into difficulties with shader code when it comes to merging textures between tiles.

Difficulties choosing between large mesh with submeshes or indivdual meshes for each tile. This project used many individual meshes each with its own texture. Issues with implementing texture blending system between each tile. After much trial and error i have decided the
individual mesh system works better. Along with a fresh code base.


Current version using individual mesh system
